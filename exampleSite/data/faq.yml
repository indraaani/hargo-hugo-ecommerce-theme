  - title : re Melanin products 'all-natural'?
    content : Melanin is a science-first brand. We don't believe in 'natural' being better for your skin, because that is simply not the truth. Natural ingredients have the potential to be harmful to the skin (e.g. lavender or grapefruit oil are allergens!). We use naturally-derived ingredients that are safe and stable. (And remember -- everything is a chemical! There is no such thing as 'chemical-free' products!)
